'''
This module is a small utility that is meant to be coded by the user
while interacting with the GUI. Currently these graphics require a lot
of attention and customization to make the visualization ideal, and
the GUI has been provided to make this easier. However, we don't have GUI
commands for every capability, so the three functions here can be called
interactively. The 'on_startup' function runs when the GUI launches, and
the other two are called using buttons. Every time they are called, they
get re-loaded, which is helpful for iterating to get the right design.

The three functions in there all take two arguments, one for the
ArtManager object and one for the DataManager object. The user then has
essentially full access to the functions that have coded to-date for
generating the graphic.
