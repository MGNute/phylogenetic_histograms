# PICAN-PI

This repository contains the code used in the paper "PICAN-PI: A Graphical Schema to Visualize Microbial Biodiversity" by Nute et al. It contains a reference implementation of the PICAN-PI graph and some scripts that can be used in conjuction with the publicly available data on the Illinois Data Bank (LINK) to reproduce the graphics used in that paper.
